Thanks!
=======

Thanks to everyone who made this year another wonderful event.
We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible.

We have posted the `photos <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/sets/72157674031974295>`_,  :doc:`transparency report </conf/eu/2016/news/code-of-conduct-report>`, and `videos <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpnN8fXXHwPtPY33aLGGhYLJ>`_ from the conference for those who couldn't attend.
Hopefully they allow you to bask in the beauty of the event from the comfort of your own chair.

We hope you'll join us again next year.
We'll be announcing details about our 2017 conference soon.

About
=====

Join 250 people for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about documentation
systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and more. Past talks
have also covered such diverse topics as typography, empathy, and
`Wabi-sabi <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi>`_.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room: Writers, Developers, Support Folks. We all have things to
learn from each other, and there's no better way than sitting together
and talking.

The main presentation track takes place from **September 19-20 (Monday and
Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm**. Each afternoon we will also host an unconference
room in parallel to the main presentations, where you can break away to open-space
sessions, workshops, hackfests, or smaller discussions. On Sunday before the main
conference we will hold a writing day and welcome reception.

Our venue for the conference and writing day is the `Auto Klub <http://www.ganimed.cz/>`_ right
next to the train station in the Prague city center. Inspired by the Crystal Ballroom, the
main presentations will be held in (you guessed it) a ballroom, and the unconference sessions
will be held in adjoining rooms.

The venue has a long history and beautiful architecture, as well as a few surprises!
Auto Klub is accessible with an internal lift and ramps from the street level.
