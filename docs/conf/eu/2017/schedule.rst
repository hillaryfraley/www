Schedule
========

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn
from each other in different ways.

Saturday, September 9
---------------------

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the :doc:`Boat Tour of Prague </conf/eu/2017/boat>`.
If you get into town early, join us and experience Prague from the water.

Sunday, September 10
--------------------

Writing Day & Reception will be held at `Auto Klub, Opletalova 1337/29, Praha 1 <https://goo.gl/maps/dcbYPV5x5DN2>`_.

During the day, we'll hold our :doc:`Writing Day documentation
sprints </conf/eu/2017/writing-day>`, followed by the conference
reception in the evening.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference
reception. You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over
some drinks and snacks.

We'll also help groups organize dinner plans, so you can continue your
conversations over more substantial food as well.
