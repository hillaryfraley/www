Write the Docs Boat Tour
========================

Prague is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, and one of the best ways to
experience it is by cruising in a boat up and down the Vltava river. If you're only
in town for a few days, it's a perfect sampling of the main architectural features
and historical monuments of the city, most of which are near the river.

Of course, you can also walk around, but we tried that the first year and got a
little sunburned! Last year we got rained on, but being in a boat we didn't mind
so much, so a two-hour tour of the highlights of the city while being protected from
the elements it is again!
