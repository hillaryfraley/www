About the Venue
===============

Our venue is Union Hall at 1311 Vine Street in Cincinnati: http://unionhallcincy.com/.

Union Hall also has a number of conference rooms and smaller huddle rooms available for rent, suitable for breakout sessions and sprints. Guests are also free to use any of the open coworking space while attending.

Union Hall is in Cincinnatiâ€™s historic Over the Rhine neighborhood, which has seen a large-scale revitalization over the last five years. It is surrounded by restaurants and plenty of nightlife options, including an arcade bar and a board game bar. Union Hall is a short walk to two stops of the Cincinnati streetcar, a three-mile loop through downtown and Over the Rhine that connects the riverfront, hotels, restaurants, and major Cincinnati landmarks.
