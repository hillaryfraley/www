Announcing Write the Docs Cincinnati + Open Help Website, Call for Organizers, and CFP
======================================================================================

Welcome to the official launch of `Write the Docs Cincinnati + Open Help 2018 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/>`_! We are excited to announce the first-ever collaboration between Write the Docs and Open Help, coming this August.

Since 2011, the Open Help Conference in Cincinnati featured attendee-led discussions and sprints for a wide range of people working on open-source and community-based projects. This year, Write the Docs and Open Help are coming together to bring 5 days of talks, conversations, and doc sprints a little closer to home for our East Coast and Midwestern documentarians!

Here's a quick overview of the schedule:

* Day 1: Talks on all things technical documentation
* Day 2: Unconference discussion and open space
* Days 3-5: Documentation sprints and writing days

Write the Docs Cincinnati + Open Help is scheduled for August 18-22, 2018 at `Union Hall <http://unionhallcincy.com/>`_ in the historic Over the Rhine neighborhood in `Cincinnati, Ohio <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Union+Hall/@39.109885,-84.515631,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3caee5bfc65866b3!8m2!3d39.109885!4d-84.515631>`_.
