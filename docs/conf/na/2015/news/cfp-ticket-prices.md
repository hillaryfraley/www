# Announcing Call for Proposals and Ticket Sales

Today we are announcing our Call for Proposals and ticket sales.
Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with
our wonderful community of documentarians.

## Call for Proposals

Although the general focus of Write the Docs is on documentation,
there's a strong emphasis on the software industry. Within that thematic
scope, we love having wide-ranging content that will stretch people in
new directions.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a new way.
Teaching entirely new ideas to others can be magical, and we are always
delighted with the breadth of knowledge that our community brings together.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world
experience and research. Whether it's a story about spreading the
documentarian gospel in your company or tips and tricks for writing that
you've learned, come share it with people who are eager to know.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the respect and
consideration they deserve. Come share the problems with documentation your
company overcame, or how you ensure documentation is an organizational priority.

You can read our full [Call for Proposals](/conf/na/2015/cfp)
on the website.

## Tickets

Write the Docs is a community event, organized and run by volunteers. The
conference does not generate any income, and all revenue from ticket sales and
sponsorships goes towards improving the conference. We believe that everyone
who cares about this topic has a place at our event.

This year, our ticket prices will ensure that the absolute cost of the
conference is covered, with revenue from sponsorships used to extend the
conference and make it substantially more awesome.

If you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email
us at [portland@writethedocs.org](mailto:portland@writethedocs.org) and we can
work something out.

#### Ticket Sales

As with the previous years, we have tiered pricing to make it fair for
everyone. Please buy the ticket that best fits your situation.
