Schedule
========

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn
from each other in different ways.

Saturday, May 13
----------------

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the :doc:`annual hike to Pittock Mansion </conf/na/2017/hike>`.
If you get into town early,
join us on the hike and take the chance to explore Portland in all of its glory.

The hike starts at **2pm** on Saturday.

Sunday, May 14
--------------

The Writing Day, Workshops, & Reception will be held at **Crystal Ballroom located at 1332 W
Burnside St**.

During the day, we'll hold our :doc:`Writing Day documentation
sprints </conf/na/2017/writing-day>`, followed by the conference
reception in the evening. We also have two half-day :doc:`workshops </conf/na/2017/workshops>`
running in parallel with the writing day.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference
reception. You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over
some drinks and snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans, so
you can continue your conversations over more substantial food as well.
