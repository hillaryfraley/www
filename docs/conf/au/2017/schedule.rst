Schedule
========

Write the Docs Day is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn
from each other in different ways.

Morning - Writing (Half) Day
------------------------------

We'll be creating and editing content, so bring along your laptop and any other
tools you need to write and to connect to the internet via WiFi.

Preparation for contributing to open source projects:

* Sign up for a GitHub_ account if you don't already have one. (You can sign up
  during the Write the Docs Day, but it'll save time if you do it earlier.)
* Take a look at the `GitHub Hello World tutorial`_. If it turns out
  not to be fun, don't worry. We'll have people at the Write the Docs Day to
  help everyone get started and learn how to make open source contributions on
  GitHub.
* Gain a basic understanding of Markdown_, the markup language used on much of GitHub.
