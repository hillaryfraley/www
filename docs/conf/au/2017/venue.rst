Accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All conference spaces at Meat Market are wheelchair accessible.

The venue has:

* step-free access to all parts of the conference
* private entrance and space for all activities during all conference events
* accessible, clearly labeled restrooms on the ground floor

Low Vision or Hard of Hearing
*****************************

Preferred seating will be provided for attendees who request it. Please contact us about any
lighting requirements you may have, and we will do our best to meet them.

Bring your own (BYO) food
***************************

Instead of having a lunch at the venue, we will head to the closest cafe/s, pub or half a dozen places (including a few that cater to various dietary requirements).
Melbourne has a great coffee culture and there are at least 2-3 really good cafe's within a 10 min walk that can cater to your caffeine needs.

Accessible restrooms are on the ground floor near the meeting room.
The venue does not have gender-neutral or family restrooms available. Use the restroom for the gender with which you identify.
