Style Guide
===========

This document hopes to clarify the way we talk about the things we do.

Write the Docs
--------------

We are called **Write the Docs**.
The *the* is not capitalized.

We do however use the acronym **WTD**.

.. container:: good

    Good::

        I'm going to Write the Docs.
        What happened at WTD last year?

.. container:: bad

    Bad::

        I'm going to Write The Docs
        What happened at WtD last year?


Conferences
-----------

At the beginning, there was but one *Write the Docs*.
After that, we branched out to a *North American* and *European* set of conferences.
Now, we see that there may one day be more than one conference per continent, so we started naming the events after the city.

So our 2017 conferences are officially called:

* Write the Docs Portland 2017
* Write the Docs Prague 2017


.. container:: good

    Good::

        We have some announcements about Write the Docs Portland
        Write the Docs Portland 2017 will be held again this year


.. container:: bad

    Bad::

       Are you going to Write the Docs North America?
       I heard that Write the Docs NA is great


Meetups
-------

We use one word to refer to our **meetups**, and it isn't capitalized unless used in a title.

Titles
------

For page titles, or Heading1 as they are sometimes called, we use title-case.

If the page includes multiple sub-headings (H2, H3), we usually use sentence-case unless the titles include terminology that is supposed to be capitalized, such as "Writing Day".

Website content
---------------

Our website uses mostly reStructured Text (RST) markup format. We still have some legacy content in Markdown but we try to retire it whenever we encounter it.

Here are some guidelines when writing RST content for the WTD website:

* Use one-sentence-per-line and do not break sentences across multiple lines.
* If you are cross-referencing to a different page within our website, use the doc directive and not a hyperlink.
* If you are in doubt about how to tag titles, lists, or anything else, the :doc:`/about-us` is a good example for how we tag our content files.
